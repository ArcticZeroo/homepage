                    I work on new features, bug fixes, and customer-reported problems affecting the shared client-side
                    syncing software which powers Outlook for iOS, Mac, and Android. In addition to regular contributions
                    across areas within my team, I own the entirety of authentication. I've been working with client teams
                    for all three Outlook apps in order to investigate authentication issues; build new auth flows and fix
                    bugs to solve escalations from major companies; and overall provide a relatively seamless auth
                    experience for users. The majority of our programming is in C++, but I have also made contributions
                    to tools and other internal applications in C#, JavaScript/TypeScript/node.js, Kotlin, and more.

                    significant maintenance and server cost burdens. This work was done in C++.

                    filtering decisions per minute. These safeguards were implemented in Java.

                    I built a new web dashboard which allowed DevOps to track stalled/failed video encoder jobs in order to
                    improve video encoder system throughput and prevent excessive cost from stalled jobs. The dashboard
                    was built from scratch with React in the frontend and C# in the backend.

                    I also helped build many foundational components and pages in a new YouTube-like React app intended
